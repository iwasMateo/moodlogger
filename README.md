# moodlogger
An attempt at making a mood logger for me and friends.

## How is this supposed to work?

It should work by letting you input multiple people into a sort of spreadsheet and just letting you log every slither of mood from your friends family and associates that you might run into.

## When is this going to be functional?

I am aiming to get this done until october 2025 since I want to start tracking then exactly.

## What will this be written in? 

Honestly I have no clue

## Are you certain you'll finish this?

 Absolutely not
